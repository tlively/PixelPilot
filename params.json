{"name":"PixelPilot - A tutorial for making 2D games in Java","tagline":"A small Asteroids-esque game created with standard Java libraries for educational purposes","body":"## About\r\nPixelPilot is a small Asteroids-esque game written with standard Java libraries for educational purposes. This tutorial will guide you through the development of your own version of PixelPilot. Along the way you will learn parts of the standard Java API that will let you build more interactive and dynamic graphical applications as well as skills and techniques that will be useful for creating simple videogames in any language. By the end, you will have the skills you need to write your own 2D games in Java.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial assumes you are already familiar with programming in the Java language, though it does not assume knowledge of any specific API. In particular, you do not need to know how to write graphical programs to be able to follow along with this tutorial.\r\n\r\n## Part 0: Setup\r\n#### Download the code\r\nThere are two options for getting the PixelPilot code and resources.\r\n\r\n1. Download a the code with one of the archive links at the top of this page.\r\n\r\n2. Run `git clone https://github.com/tlively/PixelPilot.git` from the directory where you want the repository.\r\n\r\n#### Compiling\r\nin PixelPilot directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ javac -d bin/ src/PixelPilot.java\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis will place all the generated class files in PixelPilot/bin\r\n\r\n#### Create a JAR \r\nIn PixelPilot/bin directory\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jar cmf manifest.mf PixelPilot.jar *\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis will create a Java Archive, PixelPilot.jar, which can be run with\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar PixelPilot.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Play\r\ngoal: pilot the ship around the screen, shooting asteroids. Try to survive as long as possible and get a high score!\r\n\r\n| Key | Action |\r\n| :-- | :----- |\r\n| w   | accelerate forward |\r\n| a   | accelerate backward |\r\n| s   | accelerate left |\r\n| d   | accelerate right |\r\n| j   | rotate counterclockwise |\r\n| k   | rotate clockwise |\r\n| space | fire |\r\n| esc   | pause/unpause |\r\n| enter | start a new game from the game over screen |\r\n\r\nYou start with 3 lives, which you can lose by running into an asteroid\r\nor leaving the window. You can gain lives by reaching 200, 400, 800, etc.\r\npoints. shooting an asteroid is worth 10 points, with up to 6 bonus\r\npoints based on the time it took to shoot it. The number of asteroids\r\nwill rise, and so will their speed. When you die, you start back in the\r\nmiddle of the screen. You will be invincible for 3 seconds, during which\r\nyou can move, but not shoot.\r\n\r\ngood luck, and have fun!\r\n\r\n## Part 1: The Window\r\nSo how in the world are we going to start writing our own game? A good place to start is the **Window**. After all, we can't exactly draw our game each frame if we don't have a window to draw it on. As we will see later, we need the window in order to capture user input from the mouse and keyboard as well.\r\n\r\nIn Java, a window is represented as a *JFrame* object. As you can see in the PixelPilot source code, we have `public class PixelPilot extends JFrame`. This makes sense because in a way, the game is a window. However, for larger games it may make more sense to separate the game functionality from the window functionality.\r\n\r\nSimply instantiating the *JFrame* will not make a window appear, though. First we must tell the window how we want it to appear and the we must command it to become visible. Since *PixelPilot* is a subclass of *JFrame*, it makes sense to complete these tasks in its constructor. Let's look at the constructor code.\r\n\r\n    // constructor creates game window\r\n    private PixelPilot() {\r\n        this.setSize(WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT);\r\n        this.setTitle(WINDOW_TITLE);\r\n        this.setResizable(false);\r\n        this.setLocationRelativeTo(null); // will create window in center of screen\r\n        this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); // closing the window will close the program\r\n        this.add(new DrawingSpace()); // so we can draw stuff in the window\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe constructor is private since we don't want the game to be instantiated from outside of our code. *setSize*, *setTitle*, *setResizable*, *setLocationRelativeTo*, and *setDefaultCloseOperation* are all methods of *JFrame*. Most of them are self-expanatory, but if you want to learn more, you should go poke around the Java API reference for *JFrame*. We choose not to make the window resizable because drawing the game is much simpler if we can always assume that our drawing region is a constant number of pixels tall and wide. But as it turns out, just having a *JFrame* is not enough for our application to show anything interesting. For that we need to use *add* to put some content in our window.\r\n\r\nThe argument *add* takes can be any subclass of *JComponent*. All of the GUI components provided by Java are subclasses of *JComponent*, but in this case we will add an instance of our own subclass called *DrawingSpace*. This *DrawingSpace* will be the only component in our window, so the window's layout manager will let it fill up the entire window. All of our game visuals will be drawn onto this component, not onto the window directly.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the only method that *DrawingSpace* implements.\r\n\r\n    public void paint(Graphics g) {\r\n        Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;\r\n        PixelPilot.renderFrame(g2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*paint* is the only method that every subclass of *JComponent* must implement, because it tells the windowing system how to visually represent the component. We don't call this method directly, but rather call the *repaint* method of our *JFrame* (the *PixelPilot* instance) and let the windowing system handle calling *paint* on everything it needs to. This implementation of *paint* is very simple, as it simply casts the graphics context it receives into the more specific and useful 2D graphics context and passes responsibility for drawing to the graphics context to the game. Don't worry about the details of drawing right now, as we have some more foundational knowledge to get through first.\r\n\r\nEven after all this work, the window will still not appear. There is one last thing we need to do after the *JFrame* has been instantiated and the *DrawingSpace* component has been added to it. We must call `setVisible(true)` on our *JFrame* instance in order to make the window appear. As you can see in the source code, *setVisible* is the first command in our *main* method. Since our instance of *PixelPilot* is stored in a static variable, we can be sure that everything in the windowing system is set up and ready to go by the time execution starts in *main*.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the tutorial, you should be able to create a visible window by instantiating a *JFrame* and using its methods to configure it properly. You should also be able to add a custom *JComponent* to the window, but it won't be able to do anything yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Part 2: The Game Loop\r\nGreat, now that we've got a window to look at we need to think about how we're going to make a game with it. The most fundamental part of any game is the **game loop**. The game loop has three parts: Update the game logic, clear the screen, and render (draw) the game objects to the screen.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
